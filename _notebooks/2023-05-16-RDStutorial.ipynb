    "# What is RDS? \n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Definition: Rather than having a database stored on a local file, the RDS database is stored on the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Research/More Information: \n",
    "- RDS: Relational Database Service\n",
    "   -  a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows individuals to set up, operate, and scale a database while storing it in the cloud\n",
    "   -  RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a MySQL database instance in the case of AP Computer Science at Del Norte High Schools\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using RDS, individuals can offload the administrative tasks of database management\n",
    "   - examples: hardware provisioning, software patching, backups, and database scaling, to AW\n",
    "   - RDS takes care of the underlying infrastructure allowing more time to work on website features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Features and Benefits of RDS:\n",
    "   - Managed service: AWS manages the infrastructure, database setup, patching, and backups, reducing your administrative burden.\n",
    "   - Scalability: RDS allows you to scale your database instance up or down based on a users needs, which ensures efficiency\n",
    "   - Security: RDS provides built-in security features, such as encryption at rest and in transit, network isolation, and user access control\n",
    "   - Automated software patching: RDS can automatically apply patches and updates to the database software, reducing downtime and ensuring security.\n",
    "   - Stores information in the cloud instead of just locally --> can not be easily deleted and ruined\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall Takeaway:\n",
    "   - RDS simplifies the process of deploying and managing relational databases, making it a popular choice for many organizations seeking a scalable and reliable database solution in the cloud\n",
    "\n",
